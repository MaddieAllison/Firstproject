<h2> A little about us!</h2>
<p> Hi guys! I'm ______ and me and my partner ______ run this blog, takign you with us as we travel all around the world</p>
<p> I'm from a little town in England called Ashton, its a pretty small, sleepy kind of a place. Back when I was a kid I always dreamed of travelling the world- and all the exciting things I would see! </p>
<p> I used to draw pictures of the eiffel tower, lady liberty and mount everest and hang them all over my room! </p>
<p> After University- where I studied Geography. I found myself in London where I worked at a bank. It was long hours and I did'nt enjoy it- I would spend most of my time planning for weekend getaways and saving up for plane tickets! </p>
<p> But it wasn't all doom and gloom, as London was where I met _____!</p>
<p> Bonding over our shared passion for travelling and adventure, we began to save our money to put towards a year long adventure! </p>
<p> After 2 year of pinching pennies, we quit out jobs and headed off to South America where we started our journey! </p>
<p> Half way through our amazing adventure- we decided we could'nt go back to the 9am London commute, and decided to work as freelancers to continue funding our travels</p>
<p> And started this blog- Long roads! So we could share our journey with all of you, and perhaps inspire a spontaneous trip or two! </p>

  <p>You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./example.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
  <img src="./local_image.png" alt="A local image">

  <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>
  <img src="http://jerrymahoney.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kitten.jpg" alt="A picture of a cat.">


  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>
  <table class='table'>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>College</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tom</td>
      <td>Oriel</td>
